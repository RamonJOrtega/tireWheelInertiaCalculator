# tireWheelInertiaCalculator
This is a static web application built with only javascript, html, and CSS.
This app calculates the rotational inertia for different sizes of tire/wheel setups.
This app is CSS focused and makes heavy use of flex containers and event listeners.

To use, clone all files from the repository.
Run LiveServer on your localhost.

Enter your Tire Diameter
Enter your Tire Weight
(Alternatively you can enter standard tire sizes e.g. 285/60R20)e
Enter your Wheel Diameter.
Enter you Wheel Weight.
See rotational inertia results at the bottom of the calculator
The faster wheel tire combination will have the lowest total rotational inertia.
